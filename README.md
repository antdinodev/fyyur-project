## I am having trouble running flask db migrate
I am trying to add new columns into my database using flask db init, flask db migrate, and flask db upgrade. Flask db init works but flask db migrate does not work.
I have already used a pip install to install all the dependecies required for this project but I am getting a no such module error.
 
 "raise exc.NoSuchModuleError(
sqlalchemy.exc.NoSuchModuleError: Can't load plugin: sqlalchemy.dialects:postgres"

Please see the screenshot.
